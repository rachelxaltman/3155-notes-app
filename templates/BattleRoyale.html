        How to Play Notes App: Battle Royale!
    </div>
    <br />
    
    Welcome to Notes App: Battle Royale;
    The hottest Notes-based party battle royale around! 
    Compete with friends and business colleagues to see who can write the most effective, most efficient, or most hilarious notes!

    Starting a match:
    - To play a game, gather your friends together.
    - Pick someone to be the referee: they'll be in charge of setting up and running the game on this site!
    - First, hit Start match
    - Then, enter in a name for your lobby.
    - Next, add your players! On the players page, use the form to enter in as many players as you want! (Recommended: 4-9) Hit next once all players have been entered.
    - Lastly, set the round topics, or let the game pick for you. On the topics page, you can either enter in 3 topics (one for each round), or leave the forms blank to have the game draw random topics for you.
    
    How to play:
        "Now this is where the fun begins"
    In Notes App: Battle Royale, the goal is to create the best and highest rated note! 
    Each round, a new topic is revealed, and players will get to write a note, add comments, and vote on their favorites!
    At the end, votes are tallied, and the lowest 1/4th of players will get knocked out!
    Each game consists of 3 rounds and topics, and at the end, the top note will be declared the Notes App Royal!
    
    Rounds + Phases:

    Round 0:
    - To start, Players will all get to pick a Title for their note! 
    - The ref should take all the player's submissions anonymously, and only share them on the Match page!

    Then, each Round is split into phases
    Phase 1, 4, and 7(Add a Note!):
    - First, a new topic will get revealed on the match page.
    - Then players will get to add a new section to their note, based on the newly revealed topic.
    - Like Titles, Refs should take this anonymously!

    Phase 2, 5, 8(Share Notes, and Add Comments!):
    - Next, the Ref should share the notes with the players!
    - Hit "Comment" on a note to open its note view.
    - Then after reading a note, have all the players shout comments as loudly as possible;
    - The ref should take down the loudest 3 they hear
    - Then, repeat until every note has been read, and hit "Submit Comments"!

    Phase 3, 6, 9(Vote!):
    - Hit the votes page, and get voting!
    - Every player gets 3 votes; have the ref take them, fill them out, and submit!
    - Be sure to consider the note in its entirety: The title, all the note sections, *and* the comments!
    - Hit Next to calculate the results; the bottom quarter will be knocked out for the next rounds.
    - Then, continue on to the next round!
    - After round 9, the game ends and the winner is declared the Notes App Royal!

    Home page:
    On the home page, all of your active and past matches will be visible.
    At any time, you can leave the match, and pick up the game right where you left off;
    Similarly, you can always click on old games to view the prize-winning notes again!
    You can also use the "Add Topics" button to add topics to the pool of randomly generated topics,
    and lastly, you can delete any matches you don't want to keep.
